In order of priority, here are the features we want to implement in the future:


# Thread-safety & multiple instances
# Encrypting sensitive data
# Importing from flat files
# Importing from databases other than SQL Server
# Localization
# Feature and/or guidelines to estimate the size of the database based on the XML dataset
