**XML to Table** is a flexible utility that shreds XML files into a relational database structure. It was designed for use in data science & data mining operations, particularly for analysis by SAS. It builds and augments the database based on the content of each XML document being imported, and does not require the XML to have been understood and modeled beforehand.
